HOW TO RUN GROUPSELECT

1) ensure Python Scripts directory is added to PATH
 a) C:\Users\Jake\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts
 (also add without Scripts)
 b) Right-click "This PC" -> Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Environmental Variables
 c) select "path" and edit; paste in Scripts path as new
2) win+R -> cmd to open command window; pip install pipenv (might need to run twice??); verify installation with "pipenv --version"; restart cmd
3) Navigate to the directory (cd C:\Users\Jake\OneDrive - University of Edinburgh\Documents\GitHub\groupselect-app) 
	Might need to point pipenv to the right Python 3.7 install: pipenv --python "C:\Users\Jake\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Python 3.7\Python 3.7 (32-bit).lnk"
4) install pipenv dependencies ("pipenv install") - if this isn't working, update pipfile to matching Python version
(might need to run pipenv --rm if there are issues with Python versioning)
(remove lock file?)

(works absolutely no issue on the IOD laptop)

pipenv install
pipenv shell
pip install fbs (only if haven't loaded pips from git source)
